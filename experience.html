    <h2>Built in Legal and Government Hearing Environments</h2>
    <p>
      Our capability comes from direct operational experience supporting hearing rooms, private sessions, and hybrid proceedings where reliability, confidentiality, and procedural integrity are non-negotiable.
      We understand courtroom pressure, tight schedules, and the need for calm, methodical incident response when the room is live.
    </p>

    <h2>Proven Delivery Across High-Stakes Proceedings</h2>
    <p>
      Digicourt’s background includes support for commissions of inquiry, royal commission-style environments, and major arbitration matters — providing ICT and AV stability for counsel, court staff, panel members, and witnesses.
      The work consistently involves secure environments, rapid troubleshooting, and strict workflow discipline.
    </p>

      <h3>What this looks like in practice</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hybrid hearing support (Teams/Zoom), including hearing-room audio, vision, and VC stability</li>
        <li>Secure recording and evidence systems operation and troubleshooting</li>
        <li>Deskside support for judicial, registry, counsel and executive stakeholders</li>
        <li>Operational support under confidential and time-critical conditions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Level 2 ICT Support Discipline</h2>
    <p>
      Digicourt is grounded in modern ICT support practice: structured incident management, clear documentation, and repeatable fixes.
      This includes high-volume ticketing workflows, identity and permissions administration, and deployment-ready Windows builds.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Incident and request management using ServiceNow-style workflows</li>
      <li>Microsoft 365 administration and troubleshooting</li>
      <li>Active Directory accounts, groups and permissions</li>
      <li>Windows 10 / Windows 11 imaging and workstation deployment</li>
      <li>Secure print environments (including uniFLOW-class systems)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Courtroom AV and Conferencing Capability</h2>
    <p>
      Courtroom audio and video requires more than “meeting-room AV”. We support end-to-end hearing workflows: microphones, foldback,
      evidence display, recording, and remote participation — with an emphasis on stability and control.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Teams and Zoom hybrid hearing workflows</li>
      <li>Hearing-room AV / VC troubleshooting and operator support</li>
      <li>DSP configuration experience (Biamp Tesira-class systems)</li>
      <li>Network-aware fault finding (Cisco fundamentals; practical troubleshooting)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Independent, Court-First Support</h2>
    <p>
      Digicourt exists to support courts and tribunals directly — not as an extension of any law firm’s internal resources.
      This independence helps reduce conflicts of interest and ensures technical decisions are aligned to court operations,
      not external litigation strategy or vendor preferences.
    </p>

    <h2>Designed for Australia</h2>
    <p>
      Digicourt operates exclusively within Australia and is experienced in the expectations of local court and government environments:
      privacy, security, defensibility of process, and professional conduct in sensitive proceedings.
